In the class Tester,

1. def iterative_mult(w) :
* perfect

2. def matrix_mult(w) :
* perfect

3. def comparison(w) :
* perfect

4. Plotting
* It's better to use a logarithmic scale on the x-axis since the inputs are powers of 10. Nevertheles, looks good.

Good work on the observations, well done !
